# Agile manifesto
- Individuals & interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

# Agile-dev-notes
- Software development is not linear process, instead it's more dynamic and ever changing environment. What makes it challenging is every problem is different.
